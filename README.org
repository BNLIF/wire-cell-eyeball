#+TITLE: Eyeballing the LAr TPC Wire Cells

* Visualization Method

The figures shown here are made with [[http://www.eukleides.org][Eukleides]] Euclidean geometry package.  

It can be installed from source or on Debian/Ubuntu with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ sudo apt-get install eukleides
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note, an older version exists which provided a GUI that allowed for editing the geometry description and dynamically setting parameters.  This work is no longer developed and relies on versions of GTK which have dropped out of current Debian distributions.

* Drawing lines

The main drawing function is in [[./wires.euk]]:

#+INCLUDE: "wires.euk" src text

Each detector's wires are parameterized by  the pitch (=spacing=, arbitrary units) and the angle (=ang= in degrees).  No spatial metric is given so only relative spacing matters.  Individual parameters are set in =wires-*.euk= files shown below.  To simply the calling a little shell script is used:

#+INCLUDE: "wires.sh" src sh

* MicroBooNE

#+INCLUDE: "wires-uboone.euk" src text

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results none :exports code
./wires.sh wires-uboone
#+END_SRC

#+INCLUDE: "wires-35t.euk" src text

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results none :exports code
./wires.sh wires-35t
#+END_SRC
